                    <p>As a Computer Science major I came into the New Media program with a technical background, opposite to the average Grady student going through the NMI. I chose the New Media program because I wanted to be able to couple my technical skills with my personal skills. Skills like networking, marketing, and learning innovative technologies. Throughout the journey I have been able to learn a lot about what I want my career to look like, and learn about the best way to achieve my goals and use technology and media to make my resume and skills stand out among the rest.
                    </p>
                    <p> Media is constantly evolving, and the best way to be in demand of any industry is to be up to date on the newest and hottest technologies. New Media has taught me to stay focused on the things that are new, and use that to my advantage in order to be the most prominent candidate in any job pool. Media will always be a pivotal part of any industry, and learning how to use media and marketing to our advantage will always give us the competitive edge. Pursuing the New Media Certificate in College was a great addition to my college portfolio. </p>

                            <p>
                                In Brown Bag I was energized weekly by Megan's introductions and learned a lot from the weekly speakers. I learned a lot about the different ways a career can become a career, and how there is no traditional track to anything. You just follow what you're interested and network as much as possible on the way. I was given multiple opportunities to network, and I even created my own business cards. This class challenged me to think of good questions, know how to respond to job offers and interact in interviews professionally, and make my strengths shine. Brown Bag was an amazing introduction into the NMI.

                            <h3 class="mb-0">Swift and SwiftUI</h3>
                            <div>For this class we learned more about app development in XCode using Swift and SwiftUI. With a technical background, I had some experience with coding. However, I learned a lot since Swift and SwiftUI are unique from any other programming language. The abstraction and polymorphism provided by the two languages are different from any other language I am familiar with. That's why learning these two languages was an interesting and demanding task. For the Final Project, Professor Emuel allowed us to create any app we wanted, it just had to consist of the concepts we had learned throughout the semester. I decided to create a guessing game app based on the Pokemon franchise. There were multiple difficulties, and two different game modes. Normal - which is a timed mode, and Race Mode - which has the same time limit every time and is a race against your personal high score.</div>

                            <h3 class="mb-0">Client Work and Front/Back End Development</h3>
                            <div>In New Media Capstone I dove head first into client work and creating high quality deliverables based on a client's requests. A team consisting of me and 4 other students created a mobile and desktop website with an application that simulates a person experiencing domestic violence. The simulation app represents the difficult decisions someone going through these kinds of hardships would have to face. This class was a challenge, as I was the lead developer and the entire application code was written solely by me. Since the simulation was user-driven, it would require me to handle many edge cases, which took an enormous amount of testing and planning. I had to plan out how the back-end "database" would hold values. I then had to convert the simulation choices into a user friendly interface for the front-end part of the application. This was the most challening aspect, and required constant collaboration between my teammates and I. I had to meet biweekly with teammates and update them on my progress, and change the course of action as requested by the client or my teammates when necessary. This class was the most fulfilling, as we created a real-world project that will be used to help educate others on such an important issue. I learned so much about teamwork, responsibility, presentation skills, and the steps of software development.
