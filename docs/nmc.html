                    <p>As a Computer Science major I came into the New Media program with a technical background, opposite to the average Grady student going through the NMI. I chose the New Media program because I wanted to be able to couple my technical skills with my personal skills. Skills like networking, marketing, and learning innovative technologies. Throughout the journey I have been able to learn a lot about what I want my career to look like, and learn about the best way to achieve my goals and use technology and media to make my resume and skills stand out among the rest.

                            <p>
                                In Brown Bag I was energized weekly by Megan's introductions and learned a lot from the weekly speakers. I learned a lot about the different ways a career can become a career, and how there is no traditional track to anything. You just follow what you're interested and network as much as possible on the way. I was given multiple opportunities to network, and I even created my own business cards. This class challenged me to think of good questions, know how to respond to job offers and interact in interviews professionally, and make my strengths shine. Brown Bag was an amazing introduction into the NMI.

                            <div>For this class we learned more about app development in XCode using Swift and SwiftUI. With a technical background, I had some experience with coding. However, I learned a lot since Swift and SwiftUI are unique from any other programming language. The abstraction and polymorphism provided by the two languages are different from any other language I am familiar with. That's why learning these two languages was an interesting and demanding task. For the Final Project, Professor Emuel allowed us to create any app we wanted, it just had to consist of the concepts we had learned throughout the semester. I decided to create a guessing game app based on the Pokemon franchise. There were multiple difficulties, and two different game modes. Normal - which is a timed mode, and Race Mode - which has the same time limit every time and is a race against your personal high score.</div>
